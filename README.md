# Example TailwindCSS Vue2 Web component

This example is extended from https://github.com/bryanvaz/vue-custom-element-shadow-examples

It shows how to use TailwindCSS with Vue to create a web component ready to be installed onto a third party website.

To use on an external website:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="./my-custom-module.js"></script>

<my-custom-module></my-custom-module>
```

Develop by using `yarn serve` and build the exportable javascript by using `yarn build`
